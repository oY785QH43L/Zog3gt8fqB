# Transact-SQL implementation of the requirements for the Iteration 1

The file [requirements.sql](./requirements.sql) contains the implementation
of the requirements for the Iteration 1.
This implementation was made in order to create a basis for the performance 
tests used to compare the average API response time for every requirement
in Iteration 1 and 2.
